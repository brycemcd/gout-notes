# Gout Notes

I've been researching gout and am using this to organize my notes.

> Gout is a disorder initiated by high levels of uric acid ... in blood (hyperuricemia), as a result of either the overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid.
> The hyperuricemia can lead to the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the joints and an inflammatory response to the crystals ...
