# Nutrition

The research is mixed and methods are not robust. My own interpretation and summary
is below:

**Foods That Help Gout**

* Skim Milk [1]
* Low-calorie yogurt [1]

**Foods to Avoid**

_real bad_

* Beer
* High purine meats (i.e. any type of liver)

_probably/maybe okay in moderation_

* Liquors
* Fish, Steak, Chicken (in order of least -> most uric acid promoting)

**Unclear**

* Whiskey

## Dietary Surveys

Zgaga et all [1] published analysis of a Scottish nutrition survey indicating
limitation of purine rich vegetables may not be appropriate. Their results also show
soda and meat tend to increase serum urate (SUA) levels while skim milk and
low-calorie yogurt have SUA lowering effects. Milk with fat and other types of yogurt
do not demonstrate these effects. Seafood has been demonstrated to raise
SUA levels but not to the effect other meats.

## Alcohol

Neogi et al. performed a case cross-over study to determine the effects of
alcohol on recurrent gout attacks. [2] Their paper chronicles increased risk of
flare-ups with increasing amounts of alcohol ingestion across three broad catagories:

1. beer
2. wine
3. liquor

While authoritative and respectable as science, the study raises some questions for
its applicability to the general population. Recruitment was done online using Google.
Generalizing the results beyond internet users who respond to ads is questionable. 
The odds ratios (OR) recorded indicate a varying relationship of alcohol to 
outbreaks. Table 2 demonstrates that the OR of having > 8 drinks in the 24 hour 
period prior to an outbreak increases the odds of an outbreak by between 63% - 602% 
(95% CI). This range indicates either a loose relationship between alcohol and gout 
or a number of unstudied confounding effects.
