## Uric Acid Lowering Medications

**Allopurinol**

The gold standard for preventing future flareups. In the U.S. a first-line defense.
Works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. In system 1.5-4.5 hours after injestion 
Plasma half-life of 1-2 hours (allopurinol) and around 15 hours (oxypurinol, a biologically oxidized form of allopurinal).

**Febuxostat (Uloric)**

A more targeted xanthine oxidase inhibitor. In system 1-1.5 hours after injestion. 
Mean terminal elimination half-life of 5-8 hours. (50% of the drug will be removed from the blood ~5-8 hours after it is in the system.)

Newer medication on market in 2009. Black-box warning applied after increase in
vascular related side effects were seen in trials. For this reason it is a second line
pharmeceutical after allopurinol has been tried.

**Benzbromarone**

In 2006, was the standard treatment of gout targeted for uric acid lowering effects. A
uricosuric agent, it reduces uric acid by increasing the excretion of uric acid in the urine. Was withdrawn from most markets in 2003 after hepatotoxicity was reported [4].

## Other Medications

**Colchocine**

## Use During Flare-ups

Uric acid lowering agents (i.e. allopurinol) should not be discontinued during a 
flareup [1]. My doctor has prescribed cochicine to manage flare-ups. Two pills should
be taken upon detecting symptoms of a flareup followed by one pill every 4-6 hours
until the flare-up subsides or diarreah is experienced.

## Use Between Flare-ups

As prescribed, uric acid lowering agents should be taken.
