## Urate Excretion

Urate is processed through the kidneys as uric acid and excreted in urine

## Crystal Degredation and Excretion

After monosodium urate (MSU) crystals form and travel to the joints, they tend to
persist for an indeterminate amount of time. Lowering serum urate (SUA) levels for
prolonged periods of time can encourage decrystalization and excretion through the
normal physiological urate excretion mechanism.

Li-yu et al document a population of patients having MSU crystals present in the knee
synovial joint even after proper control and maintenance of serum uric acid [1]. 
Flareups were reduced in patients with managed SUA levels. The percentage of paitents
with MSU crystals in the knee joint was less in patients with SUA level < 6 mg/dl.

Another study showed similar results although the population studied, methods and 
standard for SUA lowering therapy differed [2]. This study showed that dissolution
and excretion of MSU crystals required between three months and three years.
