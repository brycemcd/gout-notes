Investigates the relationship of alkalizing urine using two different substances: sodium bicarbonate and a citrate mixture. Patients were given benzbromarone to lower serum UA and one of the two alkalizing substances. Both substances had the effect of raising urine pH. Both groups had a decrease in SUA of about 130 umol/L (~ 2mg/dl).
