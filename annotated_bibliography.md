Investigates the relationship of alkalizing urine using two different substances: sodium bicarbonate and a citrate mixture. Patients were given benzbromarone to lower serum UA and one of the two alkalizing substances. Both substances had the effect of raising urine pH. Both groups had a decrease in SUA of about 130 umol/L (~ 2mg/dl).

A detailed explanation of kidney function with respect to methylxanthines. 
* Increasing urine flow naturally leads to greater solute excretion
* Methylxanthines inhibit sodium and chlorine reabsorption via adenosine receptor antagonization in the proximal tubule
* Methylxanthines stimulate the renin-angiotensin system and could contribute to hypertension though the linkage is unclear
* Methylxanthines help progress polycystic kidney disease
* Methylxanthines help progress hypertension and other nephropathies (rat model)

Protective and injurious effects are seen when rebalancing methylxanthines suggesting that the role of adenosine receptors is vast.

Caffine is seen to create increased urine flow and excretion of solutes. Although not explicit, this would reasonably have an effect of exreting excess urate at a higher rate.
